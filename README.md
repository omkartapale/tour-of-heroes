# Tour Of Heroes

Angular version 10.2.4.

In this tutorial, build your own app from the ground up, providing experience with the typical development process, as well as an introduction to basic app-design concepts, tools, and terminology.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Deployment (GitHub Pages)

Run `ng deploy --base-href=/<repositoryname>/` to deploy our project to GitHub pages with all default settings. The project will be automatically built in production mode.
